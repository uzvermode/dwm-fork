This is my personal fork of [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/).

Only the **dwm.c** file here is vanilla, and the patches are applied by the **patchdwm** script.

If you want to see my previous commits head over [here](https://github.com/wifiextender/dotfiles/commits/master)

## Installation

    bash patchdwm
    make
    sudo make install


## Goodies

Take a look in my [xinitrc](https://github.com/wifiextender/dotfiles/blob/master/archlinux-openbsd/home/frost/.config/misc/xinitrc)

Do you want statusbar program <img src="patches/bar.png" alt="" /> ?

There you go: https://github.com/wifiextender/dotfiles/tree/master/archlinux-openbsd/home/frost/.config/dwm_scripts

I've recently switched to dwm, read my blog [post](http://wifiextender.github.io/post/openbox-to-dwm/) for more information.
